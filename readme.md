# Puppeteer 1.3.0 Docset for Dash/Zeal/Velocity

## About

Built by [Cuyler Stuwe *(salembeats)*](https://github.com/salembeats).  
  
  Documentation was sourced from [the official markdown documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md), converted from markdown to HTML, and then run through [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) with the CSS selectors necessary to generate a basic docset.
